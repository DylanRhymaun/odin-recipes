        <li>Add all of the ingredients to a high-powered blender and blend until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>For the butter cauliflower, melt the vegan butter in a large pan or pot. When melted add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion turns translucent and just begins to brown.</li>
        <li>Pour in the prepared sauce and stir in the cauliflower florets. Cover and bring to a simmer. Stir the cauliflower often so the sauce doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook until the cauliflower is fork tender, about 10 minutes. Serve over rice with a side of naan and a garnish of cilantro.</li>
