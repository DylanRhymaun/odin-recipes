    <h1>Rava Kesari</h1>
    <h2>Yes, I know I spelled it wrong on the github. I'm learning.</h2>
    <h3>Kesari is a pudding like sweet that is good to look at as it is to eat. To make this delicious sweet dish the rava is roasted/toasted in ghee until the fine rava granules become fragrant and change color.</h3>

    <ol>
        <li> In a heavy kadai or a thick bottomed frying pan, take 6 tablespoons ghee.</li>
        <li> Heat ghee on medium-low heat till it melts completely.</li>
        <li> Add 3 to 4 tablespoons cashews.</li>
        <li> Fry cashews till golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep aside on kitchen paper towel or in a plate.</li>
        <li> Stirring continuously, fry the raisins.</li>
        <li> Reduce heat to low and add 1 cup (160 grams) fine rava to the ghee.</li>
        <li> When you begin to roast rava, at that time, take .75 cup (190 to 200 grams) sugar in a saucepan. The sugar syrup needs to be cooked simultaneously while roasting rava.</li>
        <li> Add 2 to 3 pinches of saffron strands.</li>
        <li> Add 2.5 cups water. Optionally, you can also add a natural yellow or orange color extract. I added 2 drops of natural orange color extract.</li>
        <li> Lower the heat and carefully pour the prepared sugar syrup in the hot ghee-rava mixture in a steady and slow stream.</li>
        <li> When the mixture starts thickening, add the fried cashews and raisins, reserving a few for garnishing.</li>
        <li> Turn off the heat and cover the pan for 5 minutes, just to allow the Kesari to steam.</li>
