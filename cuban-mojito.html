    <h1>Cuban Mojito</h1>
    <h3>This Cuban mojito is very similar to the drinks I enjoyed in Varadero, Cuba. The muddling and the order of the ingredients helps ensure that all the flavors are well blended. Serve with a straw and a decorative stir stick to keep the different flavors well mixed together.</h3>
